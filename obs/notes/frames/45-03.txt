The **high priest** asked Stephen, “**Are these things true**?” Stephen replied by reminding them of many of the great things **God** had done from the time of **Abraham** to the time of **Jesus**, and how God's people continually **disobeyed** him. Then he said, “You stubborn and **rebellious** people **always reject the Holy Spirit**, just as **your ancestors** always rejected God and killed his **prophets**. But you did something worse than they did! You killed the **Messiah**!”
